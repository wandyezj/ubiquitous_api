# Ubiquitous API
The Ubiquitous API where the same concepts and interfaces are the same everywhere so it only has to be learned once and functionality can be built on top of it.

## Background

Many concepts in programming are universal:

* Networking
* Sockets
* Regex
* Opening files
* slicing

etc...

What if common concepts shared the exact same interface?

### Advantages

* Developers can learn a concept and API once and then use them everywhere.
* The same suite of tests can be applied for many implementations, making sure that the API complies with the standard implementation and haveing an accurate representation of gaps in the implementation.
* The same set of documentation can be applied to multiple implementations.
* Libraries and extensions can build on a common foundation and add additional value to the common API.

## Vision

1. Common programming concepts are indentified and extensible APIs are developed to meet those needs.
2. The same interface is applied on top of existing APIs to achieve the same functionality.
    * Note: Ideally full implementation is achieved, however this may not always be possible, so the APIs Sets need to be broken into small units of functionality. 


## Study

An example JavaScript.
